# WhatCounts

A simple app to keep track of what counts in your life.

## Getting Started

Add and name counters using the + button. (You can delete them with the trash can buttons.)

Spin the counters to track what's important to you.

Switch to the Graphs tab to see and compare recent history.

Hit the "edit" pencil button for a graph to change a particular day's counters.
